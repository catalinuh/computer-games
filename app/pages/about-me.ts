export const aboutMe = `Hi, I'm Catalina. I'm a software engineer with 4 years of experience but I have been passionate about coding ever since I can remember. It started out as creating a webpage for my Neopets using HTML and CSS. Wanting to pursue my passion, I studied Computer Science and received my associate degree. Luckily, while studying, I found my first job as a full-stack software engineer and have been doing what I love ever since!

I use every opportunity to improve my depth of knowledge, trying to be better than I was the day before. I never stop trying to learn, doing research and constant practice until I perfect my clients' projects. Helping people achieve their goals and the resulting satisfaction from projects I've worked on with them is my ultimate objective. 

Please feel free to reach out to me at any time and thank you for stopping by!`
